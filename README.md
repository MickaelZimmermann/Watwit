# Watwit

The main goal of Watwit is to let people get some recipes depending on what they have (in their fridge, for example). This offers them the luxe not to have to think about _What To Eat_ (or "_Watwit"_) as the site proposes them some recipes.
Another goal to Watwit is to offer the possibility to people to save some of the recipes they tried : they tried a recipe and liked it ? They can add it to their account and retrieve it later, depending on what they have.
